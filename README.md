- **PDF Reports**: Generate detailed PDF reports of all merge actions for record keeping and auditing.
- **Real-time Processing**: Watch the system process your data with visual progress indicators.
- **Data Cleanup**: Delete all data feature to start fresh when needed.

## üíª Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, shadcn/ui
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Data Processing**: Custom fuzzy matching algorithms, string-similarity
- **Document Generation**: PDF generation for reporting
- **State Management**: React Query

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/customer-merge-pro.git
   cd customer-merge-pro
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000`

## üìä How It Works

1. **Import Data**: Upload your customer data CSV file through the drag-and-drop interface.
2. **Processing**: The system analyzes your data, identifying potential duplicates using multiple matching criteria.
3. **Review & Merge**: Review automatically detected duplicate groups and confirm which records to merge.
4. **Batch Processing**: Use batch operations to quickly process multiple duplicate groups.
5. **Export Clean Data**: Export your clean, deduplicated data as CSV or generate detailed PDF merge reports.

## üîç Matching Criteria

CustomerMerge Pro uses a sophisticated multi-criteria approach to identify potential duplicates:

- **Phone Number Matching**: Identical phone numbers are considered high-confidence duplicates.
- **Full Name Matching**: Combines first and last name for comprehensive matching.
- **Address Similarity**: Uses fuzzy matching to identify similar addresses.
- **Configurable Thresholds**: Adjust confidence thresholds to match your data quality needs.

## üìã CSV Format

Your CSV file should contain the following columns (headers can be customized):

- First Name
- Last Name
- Phone
- Address
- Zone/Region (optional)
- Product (optional)
- Quantity (optional)
- Price (optional)
- Purchase Date (optional)

## üß∞ Advanced Features

- **Order History Consolidation**: Combines order histories from duplicate records into a unified customer profile.
- **Data Analytics**: View statistics on your customer data and deduplication results.
- **Confidence Scoring**: Each potential duplicate match is assigned a confidence score for easy prioritization.
- **Audit Trail**: Track all merges and system actions with detailed reporting.

## üèÜ Best Practices

- Always review high-confidence matches first.
- Use batch processing for datasets with many duplicates.
- Generate merge reports after significant deduplication operations.
- Regularly export your clean data.
- Use the "Delete All Data" feature when you want to start fresh with new data.

## üìö Configuration Options

Various configuration options can be adjusted in the `.env` file:

```
PORT=5000
SIMILARITY_THRESHOLD=0.8
PHONE_MATCH_PRIORITY=HIGH
```
